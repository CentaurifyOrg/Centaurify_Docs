## Introduction

_VikingVault.sol is a smart contract written in Solidity language._

Context:

_We wanted to develop and deploy a smart contract that would allow us to incentivize and reward our community, for being long-term token HODLERS, contributing to our community, and supporting our project._

_We decided that Staking would be the safest and best solution to reach our goal, to distribute rewards among those who wants to stake their tokens with us long-term._

_TicketVault is a custom developed smart-contract for single ERC20 staking and rewards distribution._&#x20;

_With this documentation, we will give you an in-depth description of the features in this smart contract._&#x20;

## How To

* [Installation guide](../../#instructions)
* [Step-by-Step tutorial](#step-by-step-tutorial)

### Step-by-step tutorial

_To be able to follow this step-by-step tutorial, please be sure to follow the [installation guide](/README.md#install-instructions), and that you run the [unit tests](../../#test) and they passed without errors before continuing with the following steps._

#### 1. **Step One**  

* Deploy `VikingVault` staking contract.  

![Constructor screenshot](../../docs/TicketVault\_constructor.png)

* Before we can deploy the VikingVault contract, there are a couple of variables that are optional to change inside the contract constructor. These variables are located at line `110`, `112`, and `113`.

  1. `stakingPeriod` is the total number of weeks for this staking vault.  
      * The default `stakingPeriod` value is set to 13 weeks (\~3 months).  

  2. `withdrawPenaltyPeriod` is the number of weeks where rewards are being accumulated.  
      * Within this `WithdrawPenaltyPeriod`, if a stakeholder wants to withdraw their position and exit the staking pool, they will not get their accumulated rewards.  
      * The default `WithdrawPenaltyPeriod` value is set to 2 weeks (\~1/2 month).  

  3. `withdrawFee` is the percentage value of the withdrawal fee.  
      * Example fee values:  

      * 0.1% fee, use value `10`.  

      * 5% fee, use value `500`.  

      * 10% fee, use value `1000`.  

      * Default `withdrawFee` value is set to `700` (7%).  

* With these variables set in the contract code, we can now deploy the TicketVault to the network of your choice.  

  * Open [1_deploy_contracts.js](/scripts/1_deploy_contracts.js), at line `8`, change `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` with the ERC20 contract address you want to use.  

  * In your terminal, go to folder `../smart_contracts`, and enter the code below to deploy the TicketVault smart-contract.
  
  ```bash
  npx hardhat run scripts/1_deploy_contracts.js --network NETWORKNAME 
  ```  
  
  * Wait until you see the deployment confirmation and contract address from etherscan like below.
  
  ```text
  Deploying contracts with the account: 0x2fa005F3e5a5d35D431b7B8A1655d2CAc77f22AB

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  |    Deployment Status  :                                                          
  |       Contract owner  :        0x2fa005F3e5a5d35D431b7B8A1655d2CAc77f22AB
  |       Fee address     :        0x2fa005F3e5a5d35D431b7B8A1655d2CAc77f22AB
  |
  |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  |    Contract deployed  :
  |       TokenAddress    :        0x938f689d828D6d105BAc52F9DE605d6C6CCa1CD1
  |       TicketVault     :        0x6Fa408C20cEC935e4e0F3227Fbb4B12499Cb99F3
  |       StakePeriod     :        7862400 Sec.
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ```

* Now you can verify the contract on etherscan.

#### 2. **Step two**

* Add Rewards.
